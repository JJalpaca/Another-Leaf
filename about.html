      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <div id=origins>
        <p>Another Leaf began with three friends on a late night walk,
            talking about their feelings and their current experiences.
            Little did they know that talking comfortably as friends will
            give birth to a project that will affect millions of young
            people nationwide.
        </p>
        <p>Through the Enactus society, they grew their project, going through
            change after change to finally find the perfect outlet for their passion.
            Podcasts. As they continue to grow their project, their hearts and minds
            will be filled with many lessons throughout the process.
        </p>
        <p>Join us as we embark on this journey of mental health and well-being.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <div id=origins>
        <p>Oxford English Dictionary “the state of being healthy, comfortable
            and happy”
            This is the Oxford Dictionary definition of what personal
            well being, however, we know that personal well being is more than
            this. It’s about adding value to your day to day and is subjective
            to the individual. We all have different goals, personalities and
            ambitions. The Philosopher Aristotle revealed that as well as
            personal well being about happiness, it includes the fulfilment of
            long term goals - which is a concept that Another Leaf will help
            young people prepare for through the creation of well being podcasts.
          </p>
        <p>Our mission and livelihood is to make personal well-being an integral
           part of young people's lives in order to tackle the prevailing issue
           of poor mental health in young people. This helps achieve the
            UN Sustainable Development goal of Good Health and Well Being.
        </p>
        <p>Another Leaf, want to take a life course approach intervening early
           to address neglected determinants that would increase the risk of
            mental health problems from escalating.
